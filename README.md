# 📊 Sports2D Sprint Analysis App (10m Test)

This Shiny web application enables biomechanical analysis of sprint acceleration using positional data extracted from `.trc` files generated by Sports2D. It allows users to compare up to three sprint attempts over a 10-meter distance, providing key performance metrics such as:

- Maximum velocity (`vmax`)
- Time to reach maximum velocity
- Mean velocity
- Peak acceleration
- Mean acceleration until 90% of `vmax`
- Total sprint duration

The velocity curve is smoothed using cubic splines with adjustable parameters, allowing for noise reduction and clearer metric extraction.

## 🔧 Features

- Upload and compare three `.trc` files
- Customize smoothing and detection thresholds
- Visualize velocity and acceleration curves with performance markers
- Export summarized metrics for each trial
- Clean and intuitive interface with support for typical Sports2D data structure

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required packages in R:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "patchwork"))
```

2. Save the `app.R` file in a directory.

3. Run the app in RStudio or your R console:

```r
shiny::runApp("path/to/your/app.R")
```

## 📂 Input File Format

The app expects `.trc` files exported from Sports2D. The files should:
- Use tab-separated values
- Have time in the column named `...2`
- Use `Z1` for horizontal position and `X2` for vertical position (can be modified in code if different)

---

## ⚖️ Recommended Parameters

For best results, we recommend the following default parameters:
- **Start threshold (limiar início):** `1.5 m/s`
- **Time before start (delta_t_retro):** `0.3 s`
- **End margin (margem_final):** `0.3 m/s`

These can be adjusted via the app interface based on the quality and noise of your data.
